Database changes:

1. Branch
2. Wipe mongo
3. Load in MySQL tables with all attributes
4. (In Mongo) Use foreign keys to connect to joined documents and save associated arrays into collections
	e.g. Use senator id to find all donations for senator, then add 'donations' attribute set equal to array of those donations

---------------------
Take a step back and think about this differently.
Try switching to a pure-MongoDB solution. This means modifying mongoSave.py to contain updated files and better information. The individual JSON files are my best record of information, so use those to populate donations for senators (already working). I think what I need to change is how organizations get donations. There's probably a bug in there somewhere, which would explain the data loss.

This is correct. I need to go into senatorContributions.py and write a new function that generates organizations.json.
The function needs to iterate through the individual JSON files that belong to proper senators, not senContribAll.json, as that contains data for incorrect senators, and is missing data for correct ones.

I need to refactor the shit out of everything though
